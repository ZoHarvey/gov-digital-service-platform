# 🏢 Government Digital Service Platform - Enterprise Architecture Repository

This GitHub repository demonstrates a complete **Enterprise Architecture (EA) reference model** for a fictional **Government Digital Service Platform (GDSP)**. It reflects industry best practices based on **TOGAF**, **Archimate**, and **ISO 42010** principles.

---
## ✨ Overview

The GDSP aims to unify fragmented government services (e.g., Identity - Passport, National ID, Licensing, Registrations, Permits, Grants) into a secure, interoperable, cloud-native architecture for citizens and businesses a like.

## 🏛️ 1. Business Architecture

### 1.1 Business Capabilities
- Citizen Identity & Authentication
- Digital Permits and Licenses
- Public Service Grants
- Notifications & Alerts
- Case Management

### 1.2 Value Streams
- Request Permit ➔ Approve ➔ Issue
- Register Citizen ➔ Validate ➔ Enable Access

### 1.3 Stakeholders
| Role             | Responsibility                     |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| Citizen          | Service consumer                   |
| Case Officer     | Manages applications & workflows   |
| Ministry Admin   | Governance, Reporting              |
| IT Department    | Support, Integration, Security     |

## 📈 2. Application Architecture

### 2.1 Application Components
- Citizen Portal (Web + Mobile)
- eID Service
- Permit Management System
- Grant Disbursement Engine
- Notification Microservice
- API Gateway

### 2.2 Interface Inventory
| Source           | Target                 | Interface Type |
|------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| Citizen Portal   | Permit Mgmt System     | REST API       |
| Mobile App       | API Gateway            | GraphQL        |
| Notification Svc | SMS Gateway            | SOAP/XML       |

## 🔢 3. Data Architecture

### 3.1 Logical Data Model
- Citizen
- Permit
- Grant
- Application
- Notification

### 3.2 Compliance
- Data classified as **PII**
- Stored in-country per **Data Protection Act**
- Encrypt-at-rest (AES-256), in-transit (TLS 1.3)

---

## 🚀 4. Technology Architecture

### 4.1 Deployment Model
- Cloud: **Azure Government Cloud**
- Compute: **App Services + AKS (Kubernetes)**
- Identity: **Azure AD B2C**
- Database: **Azure SQL**
- API Mgmt: **Azure API Management**
- Messaging: **Azure Service Bus**
