# 🏢 Government Digital Service Platform - Enterprise Architecture Repository

This GitHub repository demonstrates a complete **Enterprise Architecture (EA) reference model** for a fictional **Government Digital Service Platform (GDSP)**. It reflects industry best practices based on **TOGAF**, **Archimate**, and **ISO 42010** principles.

---
## ✨ Overview

![Government Digital Service Platform](docs/architecture-diagram.png)

The GDSP aims to unify fragmented government services (e.g., Identity - Passport, National ID, Licensing, Registrations, Permits, Grants) into a secure, interoperable, cloud-native architecture for citizens and businesses a like.

## 🔢 3. Data Architecture

### 3.1 Logical Data Model
- Citizen
- Permit
- Grant
- Application
- Notification

### 3.2 Compliance
- Data classified as **PII**
- Stored in-country per **Data Protection Act**
- Encrypt-at-rest (AES-256), in-transit (TLS 1.3)

---

## 🚀 4. Technology Architecture

### 4.1 Deployment Model
- Cloud: **Azure Government Cloud**
- Compute: **App Services + AKS (Kubernetes)**
- Identity: **Azure AD B2C**
- Database: **Azure SQL**
